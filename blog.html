		<strong>TLV Round Two </strong>
		I told you I'd be back.  Most of you - both in the US and in Israel - didn't believe me when I said I'd return after things here quieted down...but that was my intention all along.  And here I am.  I'm in Tel Aviv for round two; back to my job, apartment, and friends for another ~2 months.

		Thank you so so much for all of your concern and messages over the past few weeks.  It felt nice knowing how many people were thinking about me and making sure that I was safe.  I intentionally waited a few weeks to write this blog post until I could clearly collect my thoughts and life had returned back to normal.  (Side note:  If you saw me at work when the explosions started, I was probably not at my best.  And if you saw me over the first few days of being back in the US, I may have snapped at you when you told me there was no way I would live in Israel again, or mentioned something about a war.  Sorry about that.)

		So here it goes ... a 3 week whirlwind:
	
	</p>

	<ul id="TLVroundtwomore">
		<li>
	On Wednesday nights I have Hebrew lessons.  I had heard during the day (this was almost 3 weeks ago) of bombings in the South; alarms had sounded, people were rushing to bomb shelters (note:  in the South when an alarm sounds you have 15-30 seconds to run to a shelter.  In Tel Aviv, you have ~3 minutes), school were being closed, and tensions were heightening.  When my tutor came to my apartment I told her about what I had heard in the news, and she assured me that I would be fine, and nothing would happen in Tel Aviv.  I called my Dad and emailed my Mom (great time for my Mom to be vacationing without phone reception) to let them know that I was, and would be, fine.  I felt comfortable and safe, and then went to sleep.
		</li>
		<li>
	I left my phone on ring that night knowing that if I didn't answer my parents would think something awful had happened to me.  And it was a good thing I did.  At ~3 am I got a phone call from my Dad telling me that the decision was made:  I needed to be on the next plane out of Israel.  It didn’t matter where I went, but I needed to leave the country as soon as possible.  I quickly looked at the Israeli news and saw that nothing had changed in the 3 hours I had been sleeping, and I still was not in danger in Tel Aviv or Ra'anana (a bit north of Tel Aviv, where my office is located).  I assured my dad that I was still okay, and that it was the middle of the night and we could discuss in a few hours when I was waking up to go to work.  I would still go to the office as planned, and would monitor the situation during the day.  I'm not sure if this was a sufficient response, but I was not worried.
</li>
		<li>
	From there I received multiple emails and texts from my mom and her friends (my second moms, with whom my mom was on vacation) telling me to call ASAP.  My mom's phone wasn't working, but I could use someone else's number to get in touch with her.  I knew that I needed to sleep to be functional during the day and told them that I would call in a few hours before I left my apartment for the day.  We FaceTimed around 630 am and I could see the sheer panic in my mom's eyes.  Because she had been without internet connection for a few days already she had no idea to what I was referring when she received my email saying I was okay (whoops).  After researching the situation in Israel (which, especially coming from American news sources, sounded awful) she got in touch with my dad, and then with me, and together they decided the next steps.  It was clear how panicked she was (for all the right reasons, obviously), and as my dad did a couple of hours earlier, she told me I needed to leave.  I understood her concern but I was not leaving then.  I explained my position, as much of Israel's situation that I knew, and said that I would bring a suitcase to work and would keep track of what was happening during the day.  I wasn't ready to make any rash decisions or jump on the first plane to who knows where.  I was in the middle of my huge project (the reason I'm working in Israel in the first place) and I couldn't/wouldn't leave...yet.  I'm not sure that my parents were happy with my response, but after a 3-way phone call I had calmed them enough to let me go to work and make a decision a bit later on.
		</li>

		<li>
	I packed a suitcase that I had zero intention of using.  And if I did need to use it, where would I be going?  Philly?  Seattle?  Ireland or Munich (to stay with friends)?  So, I brought with me the essentials:  my passport, shekels, US Dollars, jewelry, Chanel bag, iPad, laptop, chargers (that would work in Israel, US, and Europe), Kind bars, sneakers (1 shoe from 2 different pairs :-/), lululemons, and some advil.  It was early, I was tired, and I couldn’t think straight.  But since my first weeks in Israel I knew that if I needed to leave quickly nothing I owned was that important; everything was replaceable (besides me, of course).

		</li>
		<li>
	At work things were totally normal.  There were a few comments here and there about what was going on in the South, someone had family in Be'er Sheba, etc...but that's it.  Most of the conversations about the bombings were because of me.  Everyone in the office wanted to make sure I was okay and that I knew they were here for me if I needed.  I told my boss and a few co-workers how nervous my parents were and they offered to speak with them and provide some sort of comfort.  And they assured me that, to the best of their knowledge, nothing would happen in Tel Aviv.  Of course, no one could be sure.  It wasn't something that anyone could promise, but the chances of something happening in Tel Aviv were so slim that I (and my parents) had no reason to worry.  I felt okay, really.  I had my ynetnews opened all day and constantly refreshed the live feed.  "Siren heard in xxx, explosion, explosion in open field, Iron Dome intersects rocket, people lightly injured, wounded, siren heard, explosion..."  I would mention it to my officemate, to my coworkers, and still they weren't worried so neither was I.  During the day I showed a few people the facebook statuses and profiles of my friends in the US.  So many of them mentioned standing with Israel, thinking about Israel, am yisrael chai, etc.  They couldn't believe here how many people in the US were thinking about them.  So, FYI, even something so easy as writing on Facebook is really appreciated :).
		</li>
		<li>
	After an hour so of being at work and reading the news I decided to buy a one-way refundable ticket to Philadelphia.  The flight was at 11pm so I I had plenty of time to decide whether or not I would take it.  I wanted to be practical, take all necessary precautions, and offer some sort of relief to anyone in the US that was concerned about my well-being.  My parents and I were in touch multiple times during the morning.  My dad had spoken to a few Israelis he knew in the US, my mom spoke to my Poppy, I spoke with my coworkers, and had a plan if something would happen.  We decided together we would be in touch all day to monitor the situation, but it was okay for me to stay in Israel.  Still, we would reconvene around ~7pm (the latest that I could leave Tel Aviv to get to the airport in time for my flight) and make the final decision.  My parents were very reasonable; I'm sure it was difficult to allow me to make my own choice and stay.  I felt confident that I had done my research (I had mapped out the closest bomb shelters to my apartment upon moving to Israel), planning (booked a just-in-case flight home, packed a suitcase), had calmed my parents and myself, and we would take the rest step by step, hour by hour.
		</li>
		<li>
	There was a rocket aimed for Tel Aviv that landed in the sea around 6pm.  There was a siren, 3 minutes to get to a shelter, and an explosion.  People in Tel Aviv were confused; unsure of whether it was a siren, an ambulance, a bomb, etc.  I called my parents to let them know, and without even discussing, it was understood that I would leave.  I spoke with my boss, sent out the necessary emails, and in a few hours I would take the flight that I had booked earlier in the morning.
		</li>

		<li>
	Everyone in Israel was SO supportive and caring.  I'm not surprised, at all, as everyone that I have met over the past 4 months (at work, socially, etc.) has been genuinely welcoming, inviting, and caring.  But on Thursday night, when they should be focusing on their family and friends, ensuring that everyone they knew was okay, their kids were back from school, etc., they were checking in on me.  I received phone calls and messages making sure I was okay, wasn't scared, and had somewhere to be.  These are people who I've only known for a few months.  I was invited to stay with a few families of people with whom I work so I wouldn't be alone.  My coworkers insisted that I wouldn't drive home from work by myself (Did I know what to do if there was a siren?  No?  I would have to get out of the car and lay flat on the ground until the explosion had sounded) so I was given a ride, and left my car and keys at the office.  A friend called a cab for me from Tel Aviv, and I went directly to the airport.  I called my friends in Israel and they were surprised that I was leaving.  I called my friends and family in the US and they were relieved.
		</li>

		<li>
	The airport, as expected, was busy.  There were tons of tourists and groups who were leaving, and I'm guessing that the majority of them had not planned on flying out that day.  I got through to my gate with no problem, having with me only a small carry on bag and a back pack.  There was not an air of nervousness at the airport at all...things seemed normal.  Brooke's mom, who was managing the project that I had been working on from the Corp side (I was helping from the Israel side) called to tell me that she had pulled the US team from the Israel office, that they would be working remotely from Ireland for the remainder of the project, and that I should leave as well.  I really really appreciated the phone call.  After getting through security I bought dinner, changed from my work clothes in the bathroom, and boarded the flight.  I think it was when the plane doors closed that I could breathe again.  I spoke with the people in my row and they, too, had bought the plane ticket just a few hours before the flight.  I would imagine that most of the passengers had similar stories.  I definitely hadn't mentally prepared myself for this 12 hour flight, but I felt the comfort of knowing that soon my dad would pick me up in Philly, and I would be home.  I had quite a while to think while I was on the plane about what had just happened.
		</li>

		<li>
	As happy as I was to be home, I was still sad.  And confused.  I was quick to say in most of my conversations in US that this "relocation" was very temporary, that I would be returning to Israel in just a few days, I wasn't even staying for Thanksgiving that was a week away.  And back to my being sad...There were a few things that really were upsetting me.
		</li>

	<ul>
		<ol>
			<li>
	This country is amazing.  Honestly, it's almost perfect, in my opinion.  The food, the weather, the focus on family, the advances in medicine and technology, the water and desert and mountains, the history, the nightlife, the day of rest.  I love it, and I'm sure if you've been here before, you've felt similarly.  But I'm sad because so many people won't want to, or be allowed to come.  Especially after what just happened, I know that there will be tons of students who pull themselves out of Tel Aviv Study Abroad.  And there are parents who won't let their kids go on Birthright.  And families will decide to book other travel plans.  And will there ever be another rotation in Tel Aviv, as I'm doing now?  Who knows for sure, but I doubt it.  And for me, this is sad.  I want people to see what Israel has to offer, because I know if they do, they'll feel differently.  It isn't a war zone as the media may claim; there aren't camels roaming around the street with men who look like Moses (well, maybe in some parts of the country :)).  Tel Aviv is a cosmopolitan city, and it's awesome.  It's a great place to live and visit, explore, and vacation.
			</li>
		<li>
	Of course it's so great that in a moment's notice, as soon as something happens, I can leave Israel and get back to safety in the US (or any other country, for that matter).  I feel so much comfort in this fact; so long as I have my passport with me, I can go anywhere and be out of harms way.  But this is not possible for most of the Israelis.  They can't leave their homes and their families and seek refuge in another country when something happens.  And it's not as if they want to, either.  My office mate has a younger sister (23 years old) who lives in Be'er Sheba (this is in the South, where there were far too many rockets).  Her family called the sister to ask her stay in Tel Aviv for the weekend at least, but she refused.  Her home is in Be'er Sheba, her studies, her friends.  Why would she leave?  This is the mindset of many of the Israelis.  I knew how important it was to my family and friends that I left Israel, but I felt like I was taking the easy way out.  This had been my home for the past few months, and I was leaving as soon as times got tough.  And even though I never was made to feel bad about leaving and abandoning, that's how I felt.  Leaving and abandoning my friends, coworkers, newfound families...home.
	</li>
	<li>
	This is reality in Israel. (to some extent)  When I was surprised by the news, they were not.  When I was considering leaving, they were not.  They were calm and collected.  When a siren would sound people would quickly seek shelter, and then go about their daily lives after the explosion.  Work continued as per usual.  People in Tel Aviv still went to the cafes and bars, the streets were busy (maybe a bit less so), and life went out.  This is sad to me how normal it was.  (Okay, so, bombs in Tel Aviv are NOT normal by any means, but the fact that they know how to deal with this, and have to deal with hearing about bombs in the South, fights with neighbors so often, is not okay).  There is always always the possibility that something might happen.  (This is also one of the reasons why Israel/Israelis are the way they are:  It's why they work hard and play hard, why I would feel safe walking around by myself in the middle of the night and never question that I was going to get mugged or held to gunpoint, why they need to be tough, etc.)
	</li>
	<li>
	People that I know were being called into the reserves.  My friend's boyfriend was called in the middle of the night and told to be at his base in a few hours; some of my coworkers had been called in, as well.  If there were going to be ground operations, I would know some of the men and women fighting.  And this, too, upset me
	</li>
	<li>
	I could continue, but I think you get the idea.

		  		I was home for exactly two weeks.  During those two weeks I committed to working on the Israeli work time/schedule (430ish am Sunday through Thursday) as we’re right in the middle of my big project.  Still, it was really nice to see my family and friends.  Because it was right over Thanksgiving everyone was home, and I could make the most of my stay.  I got my hair cut, nails done twice, went shopping (I had brought home enough clothes for about 3 days, so if you saw me wearing lululemons and slippers out in public, don't judge.  Yes, I was cold.  Yes, everything was borrowed from my mom and/or sister.  Thanks for sharing your closets :).  Oh, and we went shopping because it was absolutely necessary; I would've been nude otherwise).  I went to yoga, enjoyed the crisp winter air, and saw far too many movies.  I spent a lot of time with my friends, spent Thanksgiving with my aunt, uncle, and cousins, who I see far too infrequently, and got to go to my 5th year high school reunion. 
		  	</li>
		  	<li>
		  		I was home due to one of the least preferable circumstances, but thanks for a really great time.  I miss you all already.
		  	</li>
		  	<li>
		  		My program in the US had planned that I would come back to Seattle, but after further discussion, I got the approval to book my flight to Tel Aviv.  I got to Tel Aviv on Saturday afternoon, threw away anything that had been in my fridge, got dinner, unpacked, and went to sleep.  The flight was uneventful, but I didn't sleep nearly enough and knew that the week at work would be crazy busy.  And it was.  I worked a lot over the past week, with very little time to get myself situated and succumb to jet lag.  I didn't see my friends until Thursday after work.  (And my fridge was completely bare until Friday).
		  	</li>
		  	<li>
		  		My first weekend back in Tel Aviv was nice and relaxing.  I had dinner with Ilana late on Thursday night.  On Friday Ilana, Steven, and I rode our bikes (which unfortunately mine was left outside while I was in the US and is now a bit rusty from the rain.  Still, it was great to be biking again.  I really missed it!) to Jaffa, went to the shuk (the shuk in Jaffa is more clothes, scarfs, jewelry, etc), bought some hummus (I can confirm that there is amazingly fresh hummus in Jaffa), watched the windsurfers (there were tons…it looks sooo cool), went to the shuk in Tel Aviv, and then made lunch.  We were exhausted after a busy morning and a ~9 mile bike ride.  Ilana and I relaxed for a bit and then made a yummy recipe for dinner.
		  	</li>
		  	<li>
Yesterday (Saturday) we again, relaxed.  Surprise surprise.  We made lunch with leftovers from the day before and then went to the namal (port) for some coffee.  It was a really nice day; the waves were huge, and the port was super crowded.  After sunset Hanukkah had officially begun and I lit the candles (twice, actually) with some friends and had sufganyot (aka Hanukkah jelly-filled donuts...mmmm).
		  	</li>


		  </ul>
	</li>
		</ol>

		<p>

Basically, it feels great to be back.  I'm really happy that it worked out that I was allowed to finish my rotation in Israel, and it was safe enough to do so.  I know I said this before, but I really appreciated all of your messages making sure I (and my friends) were okay.  Sorry for not including any funny stories, really, but I wanted to make sure that I wrote this post before it was too late.


Love and miss you all.  Happy Hanukkah!  And Mom, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
