		I told you I'd be back.  Most of you - both in the US and in Israel - didn't believe me when I said I'd return after things here quieted down...but that was my intention all along.  And here I am.  I'm in Tel Aviv for round two; back to my job, apartment, and friends for another ~2 months.
	</p>
	<p>

		Thank you so so much for all of your concern and messages over the past few weeks.  It felt nice knowing how many people were thinking about me and making sure that I was safe.  I intentionally waited a few weeks to write this blog post until I could clearly collect my thoughts and life had returned back to normal.  (Side note:  If you saw me at work when the explosions started, I was probably not at my best.  And if you saw me over the first few days of being back in the US, I may have snapped at you when you told me there was no way I would live in Israel again, or mentioned something about a war.  Sorry about that.)
	</p>
	<p>

		So here it goes ... a 3 week whirlwind:
	
	</p>
</p>

	<ul id="TLVroundtwomore">
		<li>
	On Wednesday nights I have Hebrew lessons.  I had heard during the day (this was almost 3 weeks ago) of bombings in the South; alarms had sounded, people were rushing to bomb shelters (note:  in the South when an alarm sounds you have 15-30 seconds to run to a shelter.  In Tel Aviv, you have ~3 minutes), school were being closed, and tensions were heightening.  When my tutor came to my apartment I told her about what I had heard in the news, and she assured me that I would be fine, and nothing would happen in Tel Aviv.  I called my Dad and emailed my Mom (great time for my Mom to be vacationing without phone reception) to let them know that I was, and would be, fine.  I felt comfortable and safe, and then went to sleep.
		</li>
		<li>
	I left my phone on ring that night knowing that if I didn't answer my parents would think something awful had happened to me.  And it was a good thing I did.  At ~3 am I got a phone call from my Dad telling me that the decision was made:  I needed to be on the next plane out of Israel.  It didn't matter where I went, but I needed to leave the country as soon as possible.  I quickly looked at the Israeli news and saw that nothing had changed in the 3 hours I had been sleeping, and I still was not in danger in Tel Aviv or Ra'anana (a bit north of Tel Aviv, where my office is located).  I assured my dad that I was still okay, and that it was the middle of the night and we could discuss in a few hours when I was waking up to go to work.  I would still go to the office as planned, and would monitor the situation during the day.  I'm not sure if this was a sufficient response, but I was not worried.
</li>
		<li>
	From there I received multiple emails and texts from my mom and her friends (my second moms, with whom my mom was on vacation) telling me to call ASAP.  My mom's phone wasn't working, but I could use someone else's number to get in touch with her.  I knew that I needed to sleep to be functional during the day and told them that I would call in a few hours before I left my apartment for the day.  We FaceTimed around 630 am and I could see the sheer panic in my mom's eyes.  Because she had been without internet connection for a few days already she had no idea to what I was referring when she received my email saying I was okay (whoops).  After researching the situation in Israel (which, especially coming from American news sources, sounded awful) she got in touch with my dad, and then with me, and together they decided the next steps.  It was clear how panicked she was (for all the right reasons, obviously), and as my dad did a couple of hours earlier, she told me I needed to leave.  I understood her concern but I was not leaving then.  I explained my position, as much of Israel's situation that I knew, and said that I would bring a suitcase to work and would keep track of what was happening during the day.  I wasn't ready to make any rash decisions or jump on the first plane to who knows where.  I was in the middle of my huge project (the reason I'm working in Israel in the first place) and I couldn't/wouldn't leave...yet.  I'm not sure that my parents were happy with my response, but after a 3-way phone call I had calmed them enough to let me go to work and make a decision a bit later on.
		</li>

		<li>
	I packed a suitcase that I had zero intention of using.  And if I did need to use it, where would I be going?  Philly?  Seattle?  Ireland or Munich (to stay with friends)?  So, I brought with me the essentials:  my passport, shekels, US Dollars, jewelry, Chanel bag, iPad, laptop, chargers (that would work in Israel, US, and Europe), Kind bars, sneakers (1 shoe from 2 different pairs :-/), lululemons, and some advil.  It was early, I was tired, and I couldn't think straight.  But since my first weeks in Israel I knew that if I needed to leave quickly nothing I owned was that important; everything was replaceable (besides me, of course).

		</li>
		<li>
	At work things were totally normal.  There were a few comments here and there about what was going on in the South, someone had family in Be'er Sheba, etc...but that's it.  Most of the conversations about the bombings were because of me.  Everyone in the office wanted to make sure I was okay and that I knew they were here for me if I needed.  I told my boss and a few co-workers how nervous my parents were and they offered to speak with them and provide some sort of comfort.  And they assured me that, to the best of their knowledge, nothing would happen in Tel Aviv.  Of course, no one could be sure.  It wasn't something that anyone could promise, but the chances of something happening in Tel Aviv were so slim that I (and my parents) had no reason to worry.  I felt okay, really.  I had my ynetnews opened all day and constantly refreshed the live feed.  "Siren heard in xxx, explosion, explosion in open field, Iron Dome intersects rocket, people lightly injured, wounded, siren heard, explosion..."  I would mention it to my officemate, to my coworkers, and still they weren't worried so neither was I.  During the day I showed a few people the facebook statuses and profiles of my friends in the US.  So many of them mentioned standing with Israel, thinking about Israel, am yisrael chai, etc.  They couldn't believe here how many people in the US were thinking about them.  So, FYI, even something so easy as writing on Facebook is really appreciated :).
		</li>
		<li>
	After an hour so of being at work and reading the news I decided to buy a one-way refundable ticket to Philadelphia.  The flight was at 11pm so I I had plenty of time to decide whether or not I would take it.  I wanted to be practical, take all necessary precautions, and offer some sort of relief to anyone in the US that was concerned about my well-being.  My parents and I were in touch multiple times during the morning.  My dad had spoken to a few Israelis he knew in the US, my mom spoke to my Poppy, I spoke with my coworkers, and had a plan if something would happen.  We decided together we would be in touch all day to monitor the situation, but it was okay for me to stay in Israel.  Still, we would reconvene around ~7pm (the latest that I could leave Tel Aviv to get to the airport in time for my flight) and make the final decision.  My parents were very reasonable; I'm sure it was difficult to allow me to make my own choice and stay.  I felt confident that I had done my research (I had mapped out the closest bomb shelters to my apartment upon moving to Israel), planning (booked a just-in-case flight home, packed a suitcase), had calmed my parents and myself, and we would take the rest step by step, hour by hour.
		</li>
		<li>
	There was a rocket aimed for Tel Aviv that landed in the sea around 6pm.  There was a siren, 3 minutes to get to a shelter, and an explosion.  People in Tel Aviv were confused; unsure of whether it was a siren, an ambulance, a bomb, etc.  I called my parents to let them know, and without even discussing, it was understood that I would leave.  I spoke with my boss, sent out the necessary emails, and in a few hours I would take the flight that I had booked earlier in the morning.
		</li>

		<li>
	Everyone in Israel was SO supportive and caring.  I'm not surprised, at all, as everyone that I have met over the past 4 months (at work, socially, etc.) has been genuinely welcoming, inviting, and caring.  But on Thursday night, when they should be focusing on their family and friends, ensuring that everyone they knew was okay, their kids were back from school, etc., they were checking in on me.  I received phone calls and messages making sure I was okay, wasn't scared, and had somewhere to be.  These are people who I've only known for a few months.  I was invited to stay with a few families of people with whom I work so I wouldn't be alone.  My coworkers insisted that I wouldn't drive home from work by myself (Did I know what to do if there was a siren?  No?  I would have to get out of the car and lay flat on the ground until the explosion had sounded) so I was given a ride, and left my car and keys at the office.  A friend called a cab for me from Tel Aviv, and I went directly to the airport.  I called my friends in Israel and they were surprised that I was leaving.  I called my friends and family in the US and they were relieved.
		</li>

		<li>
	The airport, as expected, was busy.  There were tons of tourists and groups who were leaving, and I'm guessing that the majority of them had not planned on flying out that day.  I got through to my gate with no problem, having with me only a small carry on bag and a back pack.  There was not an air of nervousness at the airport at all...things seemed normal.  Brooke's mom, who was managing the project that I had been working on from the Corp side (I was helping from the Israel side) called to tell me that she had pulled the US team from the Israel office, that they would be working remotely from Ireland for the remainder of the project, and that I should leave as well.  I really really appreciated the phone call.  After getting through security I bought dinner, changed from my work clothes in the bathroom, and boarded the flight.  I think it was when the plane doors closed that I could breathe again.  I spoke with the people in my row and they, too, had bought the plane ticket just a few hours before the flight.  I would imagine that most of the passengers had similar stories.  I definitely hadn't mentally prepared myself for this 12 hour flight, but I felt the comfort of knowing that soon my dad would pick me up in Philly, and I would be home.  I had quite a while to think while I was on the plane about what had just happened.
		</li>

		<li>
	As happy as I was to be home, I was still sad.  And confused.  I was quick to say in most of my conversations in US that this "relocation" was very temporary, that I would be returning to Israel in just a few days, I wasn't even staying for Thanksgiving that was a week away.  And back to my being sad...There were a few things that really were upsetting me.
		</li>

	<ul>
		<ol>
			<li>
	This country is amazing.  Honestly, it's almost perfect, in my opinion.  The food, the weather, the focus on family, the advances in medicine and technology, the water and desert and mountains, the history, the nightlife, the day of rest.  I love it, and I'm sure if you've been here before, you've felt similarly.  But I'm sad because so many people won't want to, or be allowed to come.  Especially after what just happened, I know that there will be tons of students who pull themselves out of Tel Aviv Study Abroad.  And there are parents who won't let their kids go on Birthright.  And families will decide to book other travel plans.  And will there ever be another rotation in Tel Aviv, as I'm doing now?  Who knows for sure, but I doubt it.  And for me, this is sad.  I want people to see what Israel has to offer, because I know if they do, they'll feel differently.  It isn't a war zone as the media may claim; there aren't camels roaming around the street with men who look like Moses (well, maybe in some parts of the country :)).  Tel Aviv is a cosmopolitan city, and it's awesome.  It's a great place to live and visit, explore, and vacation.
			</li>
		<li>
	Of course it's so great that in a moment's notice, as soon as something happens, I can leave Israel and get back to safety in the US (or any other country, for that matter).  I feel so much comfort in this fact; so long as I have my passport with me, I can go anywhere and be out of harms way.  But this is not possible for most of the Israelis.  They can't leave their homes and their families and seek refuge in another country when something happens.  And it's not as if they want to, either.  My office mate has a younger sister (23 years old) who lives in Be'er Sheba (this is in the South, where there were far too many rockets).  Her family called the sister to ask her stay in Tel Aviv for the weekend at least, but she refused.  Her home is in Be'er Sheba, her studies, her friends.  Why would she leave?  This is the mindset of many of the Israelis.  I knew how important it was to my family and friends that I left Israel, but I felt like I was taking the easy way out.  This had been my home for the past few months, and I was leaving as soon as times got tough.  And even though I never was made to feel bad about leaving and abandoning, that's how I felt.  Leaving and abandoning my friends, coworkers, newfound families...home.
	</li>
	<li>
	This is reality in Israel. (to some extent)  When I was surprised by the news, they were not.  When I was considering leaving, they were not.  They were calm and collected.  When a siren would sound people would quickly seek shelter, and then go about their daily lives after the explosion.  Work continued as per usual.  People in Tel Aviv still went to the cafes and bars, the streets were busy (maybe a bit less so), and life went out.  This is sad to me how normal it was.  (Okay, so, bombs in Tel Aviv are NOT normal by any means, but the fact that they know how to deal with this, and have to deal with hearing about bombs in the South, fights with neighbors so often, is not okay).  There is always always the possibility that something might happen.  (This is also one of the reasons why Israel/Israelis are the way they are:  It's why they work hard and play hard, why I would feel safe walking around by myself in the middle of the night and never question that I was going to get mugged or held to gunpoint, why they need to be tough, etc.)
	</li>
	<li>
	People that I know were being called into the reserves.  My friend's boyfriend was called in the middle of the night and told to be at his base in a few hours; some of my coworkers had been called in, as well.  If there were going to be ground operations, I would know some of the men and women fighting.  And this, too, upset me
	</li>
	<li>
	I could continue, but I think you get the idea.
		  <ul>
		  	<li>
		  		I was home for exactly two weeks.  During those two weeks I committed to working on the Israeli work time/schedule (430ish am Sunday through Thursday) as we're right in the middle of my big project.  Still, it was really nice to see my family and friends.  Because it was right over Thanksgiving everyone was home, and I could make the most of my stay.  I got my hair cut, nails done twice, went shopping (I had brought home enough clothes for about 3 days, so if you saw me wearing lululemons and slippers out in public, don't judge.  Yes, I was cold.  Yes, everything was borrowed from my mom and/or sister.  Thanks for sharing your closets :).  Oh, and we went shopping because it was absolutely necessary; I would've been nude otherwise).  I went to yoga, enjoyed the crisp winter air, and saw far too many movies.  I spent a lot of time with my friends, spent Thanksgiving with my aunt, uncle, and cousins, who I see far too infrequently, and got to go to my 5th year high school reunion. 
		  	</li>
		  	<li>
		  		I was home due to one of the least preferable circumstances, but thanks for a really great time.  I miss you all already.
		  	</li>
		  	<li>
		  		My program in the US had planned that I would come back to Seattle, but after further discussion, I got the approval to book my flight to Tel Aviv.  I got to Tel Aviv on Saturday afternoon, threw away anything that had been in my fridge, got dinner, unpacked, and went to sleep.  The flight was uneventful, but I didn't sleep nearly enough and knew that the week at work would be crazy busy.  And it was.  I worked a lot over the past week, with very little time to get myself situated and succumb to jet lag.  I didn't see my friends until Thursday after work.  (And my fridge was completely bare until Friday).
		  	</li>
		  	<li>
		  		My first weekend back in Tel Aviv was nice and relaxing.  I had dinner with Ilana late on Thursday night.  On Friday Ilana, Steven, and I rode our bikes (which unfortunately mine was left outside while I was in the US and is now a bit rusty from the rain.  Still, it was great to be biking again.  I really missed it!) to Jaffa, went to the shuk (the shuk in Jaffa is more clothes, scarfs, jewelry, etc), bought some hummus (I can confirm that there is amazingly fresh hummus in Jaffa), watched the windsurfers (there were tons…it looks sooo cool), went to the shuk in Tel Aviv, and then made lunch.  We were exhausted after a busy morning and a ~9 mile bike ride.  Ilana and I relaxed for a bit and then made a yummy recipe for dinner.
		  	</li>
		  	<li>
Yesterday (Saturday) we again, relaxed.  Surprise surprise.  We made lunch with leftovers from the day before and then went to the namal (port) for some coffee.  It was a really nice day; the waves were huge, and the port was super crowded.  After sunset Hanukkah had officially begun and I lit the candles (twice, actually) with some friends and had sufganyot (aka Hanukkah jelly-filled donuts...mmmm).
		  	</li>


		  </ul>
	</li>
		</ol>

		<p>

Basically, it feels great to be back.  I'm really happy that it worked out that I was allowed to finish my rotation in Israel, and it was safe enough to do so.  I know I said this before, but I really appreciated all of your messages making sure I (and my friends) were okay.  Sorry for not including any funny stories, really, but I wanted to make sure that I wrote this post before it was too late.
</p>
<p>

Love and miss you all.  Happy Hanukkah!  And Mom, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

	a quiet few weeks
	</p>
	<p class="dates">

	<p id="aquietfewweekstext">
		Well, hello!  It's been a while since my last update, but I think more has happened in the US over the past few weeks than with me here in Israel.  I was glad to hear that all of my family and friends, despite a few power outages, leaks, and floods, were okay after enduring the much unwelcomed visit of Hurricane Sandy.  And then apparently there was a nor'easter?  You East Coasters just can't catch a break (thoughts about moving to the West Coast :)?  Or to Israel?!)!  Oh, and the Presidential Election.  It seems as though all of you in the US have been super busy, while I've been doing my thing here in the Holy Land.

So, what's been going on in my life recently?  I'll admit, a lot of the same.  But then again, even the most routine activities feel "cool" (and are sooo much more difficult to complete than in the US).  Anyway, here's an update:
	</p>

	<ul id="quietfewweeksmore">
		<li>
			Over the past three weeks work has definitely picked up...even more than in my last update.  Steve Ballmer (Microsoft CEO) came to visit us in Israel for the day, so there was a huge event for him.  [Side note:  I only misplaced my car once, missed the second "optional" event due to my awful navigation abilities, AND didnt exactly follow the black/white dress code (I thought it was okay to wear a grey sweater, but  I seriously was the only person at the event who didn't follow the rules).  Whoops.]  Also, the project that I've been working on since I moved here (in July) is in full swing, and there are only ~2 weeks left until we'll able to see some tangible results.  It's both nerve-wracking and exciting at the same time, and I'm hoping that my time and effort has paid off. 
		</li>
		<li>
			
			I went to a picnic with my friend Danielle at a park right by my apartment.  It was a perfect day (and Shabbat activity) to sit by the beach, eat some great food, make some (English-speaking) friends, and relax.  What a life.
		</li>
		<li>
Because we apparently hadnt eaten enough during the 5 hour picnic, we then went to a reallyyyyyy good cafe for dinner.  Think sweet potato soup, and goat cheese, pear, and honey panini.  YUM (like any of the food here is anything but...)
</li>
<li>
I now have a basket AND a bell, and I'm even more obsessed with my bike.  The first night that I rode home with my new bike accessories (again, thanks Steven), I packed the basket with my sweater, purse, and leftovers from dinner [side note:  Ilana and I consulted Pinterest and made a delicious recipe:  sweet potato stuffed with braised coconut spinach and chickpeas].  I don't know if I've mentioned before that some of the curbs/crosswalks don't have a downward-sloping area for bikers and walkers.  And because of this, I'll usually get off my bike, walk it across the street, lift it over the curb, and then continue riding.  That night, however, I decided to just go for it.  I think I'm the ONLY person constantly jumping on and off during the ride, so if everyone else can manage this, it can't be that hard.  So much for that.  I pretty much went straight into the curb, somehow made my way over it, but everything in the  basket ended up on the ground.  Perfect.  The basket contents (it was mostly the leftovers that I was worried about) stayed relatively intact, though.
		</li>
<li>
	The next afternoon I was in the mood for a bike ride, went downstairs all ready to go, and realized my back tire was completely flat.  Fabulous.  I've been locking my bike to a pipe kind of close to someone's apartment, and just as I saw this the guys came outside and told me that the bike was “disturbing” them and asked if I could move it.  Tell me, please, how is my bike disturbing you?  Is it making too much noise at night?  Waking you up in the mornings?  I didn't think so.  Still, I asked them if they knew what happened to my tire (wondering if they did this to my bike) and agreed to move its parking location.  Steven, again, I owe you.  24 hours later and the bike was as good as new :).
</li>
<li>
I've even started waking up early a few mornings a week to go for a bike ride.  My usual route is 6 miles, along the tayalet (boardwalk), towards Jaffa.  There are tons of people out, and the weather has gotten a bit cooler, so it's such a great way to start the day.
</li>
<li>
Oh, and, I saw someone with whom I work while I was walking my bike on Dizengoff one night (Danielle didn't have her bike with her, so I thought it'd be best to not ride mine at the time).  He said that it looked like Tel Aviv suits me... with the bike and all.  What a compliment!  And someone else at work came to my office and started speaking to me in Hebrew.  I looked at her with a blank expression, and told her that I speak English.  She was very surprised and told me that what she had said was that I looked really familiar, and she thought that we knew each other in the army.  I assured her that we did not, but I love that she thought I was Israeli :).
</li>
<li>
Danielle's parents are here visiting for the month, so I had Shabbat dinner with them last week.  Instead of staying in a hotel they used airbnb and are renting out someone's apartment in Tel Aviv for the month.  Such a great idea.  It was really nice to spend Shabbat with their family, and after that Danielle and I watched Taken (cue nightmares) and Hotel Transylvania (animation is much more my speed), and had a mini-slumber party.
</li>
<li>
Sunday night Ilana, Tal (boyfriend), and I got a drink in Tel Aviv.  Saturday night=work night, but the bars were packed.  Obviously.  One place didn’t even let us in because we weren't 24.  Lame-o.
I was super popular last week at work, with Sandy and the election.  Just so you know, Microsoft Israel is thinking about all of you :).
</li>

<li>
This past weekend was very relaxing...On Thursday night I worked late (~9pm), met Ilana on our bikes, had a late dinner, and then went to sleep.  On Friday I did my laundry (the dryer was broken... I'm soooo over this whole public laundry thing) and a few other errands (FYI:  no shuk this weekend because I went one day after work).  Later that night Ilana and I cooked Shabbat dinner; this time we made pad thai...and it was fab.  I've put up a picture of the leftovers (which, by the way, were an awesome breakfast on Saturday morning).  After making dinner we went to a bar near my apartment, had a few awesome cocktails, Tal met us for a bit, and then called we all it a night.  I lounged around for most of the day on Saturday and then met up with Ilana again for tea at an "American Cafe".  Not so sure what makes it an American Cafe?  I should ask next time.
</li>
<li>
One of the main reasons I was so lazy this weekend was because "winter" is finally here.  The restaurants with outdoor seating have put up window-like enclosures, and one of my go-to places has even installed a heat lamp.  My favorite smoothie place next to my apartment has closed for the winter, as well.  The seasons here are a-changing.  But it's not really winter.  It has been raining a decent amount, and has gotten chillier at night for sure, but people are in coats and boots, and it's a littttlleeeeee ridiculous.  But it gave me an excuse to watch way too many hours of Revenge this weekend, so I'm okay with it.  [Side note:  I wore a dress and jean jacket yesterday (because it's still ~72 degrees) and at least five people asked me why I was dressed for summer.  Um, maybe because in the past five years I've lived in Michigan and Seattle and this is still summer weather compared to both of these places?  And maybe it's because I could only bring two suitcases to live out of for six months and I assumed it'd be dress/jean jacket weather the entire time?  But instead of giving people another reason to stare at me, today I am dressed for winter.  Whatev.]
</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	What else!?  I have a few other work stories that are funny/embarrassing/seem to be pretty typical things that would happen to me, but I think this may be it for now (and if you're interested in more, I hope you're talking to me directly, anyway)?  Now that this project, and pretty soon my time here in Israel, is quickly coming to a close, it's also time to figure out what I'm looking to do for my next rotation.  To be honest, I'm not ready.  And if my grandparents hadn't promised me jewelry upon my return then maybe I'd consider staying.  (KIDDING?)
</p>
<p>

Oh!  For anyone that can take off work I have officially scheduled my flights back to the US (thanks again, Microsoft) and will be in Florida from December 20-28th!  Because I don't see anyone jumping at the chance to visit me in Israel, maybe someone will be interested in seeing me in Boca?  I would hope so! 
</p>
<p>
Like always, love and miss you all.  Can't wait to see you soon :).

This may sound a bit surprising based on my previous posts, but the reason I'm delayed in my blogging is because I've been WORKING.  Yep, you read that correctly.  Gone are the days of short work weeks, long holidays, and drinking wine under the Tuscan sun.  These have been replaced by two-shift work days [my Israeli work day (8:45-6ish), followed by my Seattle work day (ending ~8:30pm)].  Don't feel bad for me, though; I'm really enjoying myself and my time here.  It's both refreshing and comforting to be back in a routine and be fully immersed in my projects. And I've quickly learned (and am trying to adopt) the Israeli mentality of work really hard, but play even harder.
</p>
<p>

Anyway, because I promised not to write about work, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to blog about my life.  
</p>
<p>

So ... what else can I tell you?  Here is my attempt at updating you on the past two weeks:
</p>
	</p>

<ul id= "workingandplayingmore">
	<li>
		I have friends! (Don't sound so surprised).  And we've been doing normal friend things...Cooking dinner together, going to the movies (Savages with Blake Lively = very good, very gory), hanging out over the weekend, eating post-bar late-night food, sitting at brunch for hours, etc.  They've also been introducing me to their other friends, which is nice, as well.
	</li>
	<li>
		I went to Benedict's for the first time since I moved to Israel (the only other time was during the Specter/Schwartz Israel trip).  For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of eating at Benedict's, it is a very popular breakfast spot with amazing food and long lines... and is open 24 hrs a day.  One of the locations is right by my apartment but for some reason I haven't been at all over the past 3 months.  So after a fun night (think dancing and a responsible amount of drinking), we ended up at Benedict's, along with a bunch of other hungry/slightly intoxicated twenty-somethings.  I know I've mentioned this before, but there are more people on the streets, in cafes, etc, at 3am than there were in Seattle...ever (no offense, Seattle).  Back to the food; it was ah-maz-ing.  I had a stack of chocolate chip pancakes that was probably intended to serve 3 people.  Regardless, I was full and happy, and therefore the night was a success.
	</li>
		<li>
One would think that because of the previous night's post-bar activities I would be full until late the following day, or want to engage in some calorie burning activity, but no.  I slept in a bit on Friday morning and then headed to brunch with a friends.  Brunch is awesome here; people just sit outside at cafes, order different breads, cheeses/spreads, salads, eggs, coffee, and then sit for hours talking and people-watching.  So that is what we did.  When in Rome…
</li>
<li>
Oh, also...I bought a bike!  And I looooooove it.  Biking is hugely popular in Tel Aviv (I believe I mentioned this during the Yom Kippur post), and I'm happy to now be part of this trend.  I bought it for ~$70 from the Israeli version of Craigslist called "Yad Shtiem" (meaning 2nd Hand; thanks, Steven, for your help).  The bike is in decent shape, minus the semi-loose breaks and constant front-wheel squeaking, but I don't mind.  I'm using it partly for exercise, and partly for travel efficiency.  This weekend I will be getting a basket and a bell - both of which are essential to have in Tel Aviv.  So now instead of having to wait behind super slow pedestrians, I will be able to obnoxiously ring my bell to tell them to move out of my way.  AND instead of having to carry bags of groceries home from the shuk while biking (which, in fact, I did last weekend), I will be able to ride with two hands and have the bags sit in a handy-dandy basket.  (Side note:  I planned on biking directly to the shuk on Friday morning but was enjoying my ride by the beach so much that I decided to bike to Jaffa.  I then went to the shuk, bought too much food to carry, and wobbled on my bike all the way home.  It ended up being ~7 mile ride in total.)  I still have to figure out how to properly bike in the city, though.  When I'm not thinking about falling off and cracking my head open, I'm thinking about running into people.  And I'm constantly jumping on and off the bike trying to avoid too-high curbs, steep-ish hills, and uneven pavement.  Sounds enjoyable, right?
</li>
<li>
I think by now you all know how much I love the dates (and other dried fruit) that I buy from the shuk every weekend.  This past weekend I bought figs, as well, and was super excited to eat them.  I took 3 out of the bag when I got home, sat on the couch with my computer, ate 2 of them, and then bit into the 3rd.  For some unknown reason I decided to look at the inside of the 3rd fig before finishing it, and what did I see?  ANTS.  Yep, you got it.  There were ants crawling in the inside of the fig.  And I had already eaten two others.  Okay, so, I expect to see a bug here or there when buying fruit and vegetables from an outdoor market, BUT I never ever expect to see them in my food, especially something into which I have just bitten.  I wanted to throw up.  I put the fig under the kitchen faucet to wash away the bugs and threw the rest of that half-bitten fig away.  Now as for what I did with the rest of the uneaten figs (aka how well do you know my mother, and Poppy)?  At that time, absolutely nothing.  And as of now, all the figs are gone.  Nope, not in the trash.  Yep, in my stomach.  Don't judge me.   Ants = protein.  (But not vegetarian, I'm guessing?)
</li>
<li>
I fell off my bike for the first time:  I figured it was okay to ride my bike home from Ilana/Danielle's apartment after painting my toenails, because why would biking mess up toe polish?  I forgot how clumsy I have become since I moved here (side story:  I spilled hot water from my tea on me the other day during work - which is not funny - and if people weren't avoiding me after the computer, phone, and lunch tray issue, they're definitely avoiding me now).  Just as I hopped on my bike to leave their apartment I lost my balance on a very small and uneven pavement, got too close to the curb, and both my bike and I landed on the ground, between two parked cars.  Aside from having a few more scratches than before, both my bike and I are okay.  My pedicure, however, was not. :(.  At least no one was on the street at that time so I suffered very little embarrassment.
</li>
<li>
Also, I did my laundry for the third time since I've been here (so basically, I've done laundry once a month, which is nothing.  In Seattle I did laundry once a week).  Nothing special to report; instead of having to walk with my back pack full of clothes I was able to bike there, and Danielle kept me company while I was waiting, so the experience as a whole was pretty positive.  However, (depending on who is reading this, I'm not sure if I should be sharing this story, but...) two days ago I put on a pair of underwear that felt a little bit bigger than usual.  I didn't put too much thought into this as sometimes the elastic can stretch out after wearing/washing a few times, or maybe I lost weight (NOT!).  Over the course of the day it got increasingly uncomfortable, and during one of my bathroom visits I figured out the issue.  It was, in fact, not my underwear that I was wearing.  It looked similar to something I would wear, but it was absolutely not mine (um, it was a one-size fits all and the closest I've ever gotten to a one-size-fits-all is Michael Starr's "one-size-fits-most"s).  I have no idea whose it is, so I'm guessing it was forgotten it in the machine and I accidentally took it home.  A little gross, I know.  WHOOPS!
</li>
<li>
I just found out that one of my BFFs was accepted to the winter Birthright trip and will be extending afterward to stay with me for a few days.  YES.  I am SOOO excited.  Also, I highly suggest that in the 3 short months I have left here (ahhh only 3 months left?!), someone books a trip and stays with me.  How often do you know someone that has an apartment in Tel Aviv that you can stay with free of charge?  I know this is a little bit risky as I'm not exactly sure who's reading this blog and therefore I'm inviting everyone, but still.  I want visitors.  And Tel Aviv is awesome.  So hurry up!
		</li>
		<p>
			Hmm, okay.  I can't think of anything else right now but I will update again as soon as I have something (semi) interesting to report. 
		</p>
		<p>

Have a good day, everyone, and talk to you soon :).  Miss and love you.

	my tough life:  a week in Tuscany

		This is bit delayed, I know. But WOW. What a week! I'm so glad that I #1 was invited on the Schwan family vacation (my new surrogate family?) and #2 decided (very last minute) to take them up on the offer. Schwan family vaca crew (if you're reading this); thanks for welcoming me into your group and for such an amazing week. I hope you had as much fun as I did!
	</p>
	<p>

The week was pretty perfect; I had Sukkot and got to to enjoy a week in Tuscany with amazing (and a lot of) food and wine, and even better company. I'm now back in Tel Aviv... more relaxed (and rejuvenated for my next few busy months at work), a bit tanner, and a few pounds heavier. I'd say that sounds like a successful vacation. Details/stories about the trip to follow. And FYI: these stories are quite verbose so feel free to skip some parts, and this post is so long that I don't feel like going back and editing, so there may be a few mistakes.
</p>
<p>
<strong> The Trip: </strong>
</p>
<p>

My last blog ended with my arrival in Rome. I flew from TLV > FCO (Rome) on a 645 am flight and planned a very busy day of sightseeing that would begin right after landing (thanks to Ilana for making me an awesome itinerary). Knowing this, I intended to nap on the plane, but the little 2 year old girl next to me had a different idea. While her mom slept beside her, the little girl chose me to keep her busy (how did I get so lucky?). She spoke to me in Hebrew, I smiled, nodded, and repeated the few phrases I knew to make her think that I was semi-normal. And then we colored, listened to music, watched part of the movie, ate breakfast (I think El-Al is the only airline that still serves full hot meals free of charge. Score.), and smiled and nodded some more. Every time I tried to sleep she and her brother poked me until I was up and ready to play. So much for my napping.
</p>
<p>
After landing and getting my luggage I took a cab from the airport to my "hotel" (I was staying closer to the city/train station to make my commute to Tuscany easier the following day). The taxi driver (woman) was very unfriendly, but I tried to make conversation with her as I had never been to Rome and was interested in learning a bit about the city. About two-thirds of the way the to hotel she told me that there was some sort of demonstration and the roads were closed so she’d have to drop me off at the subway, and I could find my way to my hotel from there. Uh, fabulous. This may have brought on a bit of an attitude as I was traveling with a huge suitcase, backpack, no phone, only 10 euros, and the worst sense of directions... but I couldn't help it. She yelled at me saying I was making her feel guilty for the road closures (which were not her fault) and that it "wasn’t her job to drop me off at my hotel" (I'm sorry, what is your job then?). She pulled over at the closest subway station, charged me 5 euros more than we originally discussed, and was on her way. I stood in the rain (oh, I forgot that, it was raining) for a few seconds to get my bearings and then carried my luggage down the 3 flights of stairs to purchase a subway ticket. I got to my hotel fine, though, and only an hour later than scheduled.
</p>
<p>

I got a map from the hotel, circled the places where I wanted to go, and then started exploring. I took public transportation everywhere which was cheap and efficient (and made me wonder why for the first 20 years of my life my family and I only took cabs – and never the subway – during our visits to NYC ... Mom, Dad?). I walked to the Coliseum, past the Tomb of the Fallen Soldier, saw the Pantheon, a few different Piazzas, had lunch (see picture above) near Piazza Navona, and gelato in Piazza Navona, threw a coin into the Trevi Fountain, climbed up the Spanish Steps, and then walked around the shopping areas (Via Del Condotti, Via del Corso, etc.). And by then I was ready to collapse. I made my way back to my hotel, used the wifi in the lobby for a bit, and then went right to sleep. In all, I liked Rome a lot. It was cool being in a city with so much history. I definitely need to go back as I'd love to go inside the Coliseum and take tours of many of these places. I also didn't have enough time to go to the Vatican and St. Peter’s Basilica (to which I was looking forward) and go to a few other less touristy places that were recommended to me.

</p>
<p>
Brooke and her family arrived in Rome that night, but we planned (in the few minutes we both had internet and were able to Whatsapp) a time and a place to meet the following morning. On Saturday I left my hotel room, bought a train ticket for that afternoon, and headed to the Trevi Fountain in the hopes that our plan would work. And it did! I was so happy to see Brooke and that I was no longer traveling alone (I didn’t mind my first day alone exploring, but I’d definitely prefer traveling with other people :)). We revisited a few of the places that I saw the day before (they all thought I was slightly crazy for my previous day's activities) and then said goodbye. We would meet again in a few hours in Tuscany (they were driving, I was taking the train).
</p>
<p>
So, another transportation story...I got to Roma Termini Station (walking distance from my hotel) and waited for the the departure schedule to tell me at which gate my train would be stopping. I then schlepped all of my luggage to the correct train, which was already boarding. Once I got to the open train door I must've looked scared and confused, because a little Italian boy motioned to my bag and the steps, offering to help. [Note: He only spoke Italian (which I obviously don't speak), so the entire interaction below was done with hand motions and facial expressions.] I agreed, he jumped onto the train and pulled my bag up with him, and walked through a closing door. I was so nervous (as I had been warned on many occasions that there are little gypsy children everywhere who are skilled pickpocketers and will steal from you) that he was going to take my bag that I threw half of my body through the closing sliding door as not to lose sight of the kid. The boy looked at me like I was insane. He pressed the button on the wall and the door opened completely and I was able to get the other half of me through. Ouch. He points to my ticket and I hand it to him and he freaks out as I haven't gotten it validated (I now know you can be charged 40-100 euros for riding the train without a validated ticket). He motions to me that we should leave my bag on the train (absolutely not) while we put my ticket through the validation machine. Instead, I made him pull my bag back down the steps of the train and we ran (him faster than me, so again I was sure he was going to bolt off with my stuff) to the nearest validation machine and then back to the train. And then we started running again. I was completely winded, but there was no way he was getting away with anything of mine. He got on the train with my luggage, and I felt much better once I had my things with me. We then had a bit of an argument for how much I owed (I only had 4 euros or 20, and I sure as hell wasn't giving him 20...although he may have deserved it). From there, it was an uneventful and productive (I read a lot of my book – Where'd You Go Bernadette?) 2 hour train ride. (Oh, side note: One of the worst parts of traveling alone is the issue of using the bathroom. How can I manage going to the bathroom without taking all of my things, and feel comfortable that it’ll be there when I get back? I asked some responsible-looking Italian man to watch my bags while I went to the grossest bathroom ever on the train. Still, I survived).
</p>
<p>
Once I got off the train at Camucia-Cortona I again hoped that our plans would work out, and we would be able to meet up without any communication. I realized that my train let out at the back side of the "station" (it had 1 track, and not even a bathroom), so I dragged carried my suitcase up the stairs (for the 2nd time), crossed to the other side of the track, and found the main entrance. Phew. After another 5ish minutes of waiting, I figured I would check the back entrance of the station again to see if Brooke was waiting for me. I went up to a lady sitting on a bench, asked her if she spoke English (she did), and had her watch my bags while I went to see if the Schwans were waiting for me there. She had me check if her ride was waiting for her, too. I came back to the woman and my bag with out any good news, so we began talking. She told me she had come from Florence, that her phone wasn't working, she needed to use the bathroom, and was from Philadelphia, but lived in Seattle. She was waiting for a friend to pick her up who had left Rome earlier that morning and she wasn’t sure if/when she’d be meeting with them. Kinda weird that we had so much in common? We were both from Philadelphia and living in Seattle, waiting for a family from Seattle who was headed to Tuscany from Rome? I remembered that the family's friend was also joining us for the week and realized that we were BOTH waiting for the same person! HUGE relief. We had individually thought of plans in case we weren't picked up... walking to the nearest bar, opening a bottle of wine, screaming for help (kidding), but now we were in it together. We only waited a bit longer (about which the mosquitos were VERY happy - I was bitten all over my legs and arms) and then Schwans found us :). SUCCESS. To the villa!
<p>
Again, wow. By the time we drove towards our home for the next week it was dark out. As turned along the dirt road that led to our gated-castle-looking complex that overlooked the town of Cortona, my jaw dropped. It was beautiful, and even more awesome when I saw it in the light the next day (pictures will be in the next post). I’m not going to recap what we did every day (because with the amount of great food and wine, talking, sun bathing, and steam room-ing we did it'd clearly be bragging), but here were my highlights:
</p>
	</p>
	<ul id="italymore">
		<li>
			 Staying in a villa, instead of a hotel, makes for such a different vacation. It made me feel like I was really living there. And even with 9 people [me, Brooke & Luke (boyfriend), Terri (mom), Brenda (Terri's friend, and mine from the train station), Ryan (Brooke's brother) & Em (fiancé), and Kyle (Brooke's brother) & Kat (fiancé)] not only could we all could have our own space and bedrooms, but we also had a huge kitchen table (where we congregated much of the time: talking, eating, etc.), a pool, sauna, steam room, pool & ping pong tables, tv room, and much more. I felt so spoiled, and it was amazing.
			</li>
			<li>
 I stayed in the little girls room during our trip. I'm going to post a picture because it'll be better if you can see it for yourself rather than me trying to explain. Think purple, sparkles, and butterflies.
</li>
<li>
Internet only in the kitchen. It was sooo nice being unplugged. We were in Italy with no distractions and therefore really got to enjoy ourselves. We did spend some time checking emails and facebook around the kitchen table, but still, we were all together while we did it.
</li>
<li>
Two in-house chefs. Kinda kidding, but not really. Luke & Ryan actually cooked EVERY meal for us. Gourmet meals. And they served us. AND they made me a vegetarian version of every dish that they made. Here's an example of one day's menu: brunch - 2 pieces of toast, 1 with a poached egg, the other with English beans, side of sautéed cherry tomatoes and sausage; snack - plate of cheeses, olives, caprese salad, bread & olive oil/balsamic, meats, wine; dinner - salad, full tomato with the inside scooped out and stuffed with fresh mozzarella cheese and then put in the oven, potatoes with fresh garlic, fresh pasta with tomato sauce, chicken on the barbeque, wine; dessert - chocolate, wine
And because we had two in-house chefs, there was also the daily supermarket run. This included 10 bottles of wine, tons of different cheeses, breads, meats, and whatever else the men/cooks wanted to prepare for us. YUM.
</li>
<li>
 Our house cat, Maya. And although I'm not a fan of cats, she was super cute. And smart. We left a full chicken on the barbeque for an hour while we ate dinner, and when we went back outside there was Maya, on the ground, with a half-eaten chicken.
</li>
<li>
 Losing power after a huge night storm, and trying to call one of the house "emergency" contacts to help us. Stefano said call Laura, and Laura said to call Stefano, who then said to call Stefano. Thanks for the help!
</li>
<li>
 Laying by the pool. Doesn't getting much better than laying out in the sun with a bottle of wine and Italy vineyards in the distance. The pool itself was freezing. I went to put my feet in as it was pretty warm out, and Ryan pushed me in. I only stopped breathing for a few minutes, and then jumped off the diving board. But don’t worry...
</li>
<li>
Pushing Ryan in the pool. After a delicious dinner, playing Catchphrase and Cheers to the Governor with the whole fam, and a lot of wine, I got my revenge and Ryan ended up in the pool, fully clothed. Thanks, Em :).
</li>
<li>
Catchphrase & Cheers to the Governor were also highlights. Such a fun night.
</li>
<li>
The steam room. Unfortunately, we all came down with colds (how this happened, I have no idea) so the steam room was amazing for our decongestion. We also had a nightly Nyquil distribution.
</li>
<li>
There were TONS of bugs/flies in the house because we kept the windows and doors open for most of the time. Hidden talent of which I'm very proud: killing flies and other bugs with my bare hands. Luke also made some impressive contraptions (and made use of the vacuum) to trap the bugs.
</li>
<li>
Day trips to Cortona (cute little town, shops, restaurants, church with an awesome view, cobblestone streets/alleys), and Siena (also cute town with lots of shopping, quaint streets, and a beautiful "duomo").
</li>
<li>
Very local restaurant we went to for "linner" (lunch/dinner) on the way back from Cortona. I had Penne Cacio e Pepe. And wine. YUM.
</li>
<li>
 Our car, the Fiat Panda (which I believe Brenda named the Pinto, and something else which I can't remember). This car made us super popular, because that is apparently THE car to have. Luke did an awesome job driving it.
</li>
<li>
Okay, I could write a billion more things that were highlights, but I think I'm going to stop there. Seriously, amazing trip. I left the villa on Thursday night (2 days before the rest of the crew :() because I had an early flight on Friday. Again, I took the train from Camucia-Cortona to Roma Termini Station, and then to the Fiumicino Airport in Rome. The train ride from Termini Station to the airport was quite eventful, but I'm too embarrassed to write about it. I took a cab from the airport to my hotel (I stayed near the hotel on Thursday night because they had a free shuttle to the airport in the morning) and went to sleep. The hotel, which I had booked the day before, was brand new and actually really great (and only $80/night). And I finally had internet so I could tell someone that I had survived the journey. (Does anyone watch New Girl? In a recent episode she kept saying she was going "off the grid" and that’s what I felt like.) And then the next morning I flew back to Tel Aviv! I was glad to be "home",but was already missing everything from the week in Italy. Luckily, I still had 3 days off (love the Jewish holiday season) before starting work again to relax after my super stressful vaca. Kidding :).
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			And that's all she wrote! I think this is a pretty comprehensive recap of my past two weeks (Mom, does this suffice?). Love and miss you all. Keep in touch.
